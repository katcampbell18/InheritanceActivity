Activity#1:

Make the following application work. To check your result, print out all the object instances you created.


Activity#2:

Using the code from the previous "Inheritance completion activity #1", create an override of the equals method for the superclass, and Book and Software subclasses.


Activity#3:

Using the code from the previous 2 completion activities, convert the Product superclass to an abstract class.


Activity#4:

When used in a class declaration, the final keyword means a class can't be inherited. Why? Do this as a guarantee that the code in your class could never be overridden. This ensures other programmers won't extend your beautiful class. Final provides a safety net from a future of lesser programmers raising havoc on the future of the company.

Use code from the previous 3 examples. Now go forth and save the company by converting the Book and Software subclasses to final classes. The future is waiting for you.
